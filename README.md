# Patra Knowledge Base

The **Patra Knowledge Base** simplifies and accelerates the creation of AI/ML model cards by automating the integration of essential model details. It streamlines the process of documenting key characteristics of AI/ML models, enhancing transparency, accountability, and usability in model documentation.

By leveraging a semi-automated pipeline, this toolkit reduces the time and effort required to generate model cards. Descriptive fields such as fairness metrics, explainability insights, and more are populated automatically through scanners.

The server is built using Flask and exposes a RESTful API for interaction with the **Patra Knowledge Graph** (KG).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure the following are in place:

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** are installed and running on your machine.
- Ensure that the following ports are available: `7474` (Neo4j Web UI), `7687` (Neo4j Bolt), `5002` (REST Server).
- An **OpenAI API Key** is required. Refer to the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com) for instructions.

---

## Quickstart

### Set up Environment Variables
- Set your OpenAI API key using the following command:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
    ```

### Launch the Patra Knowledge Base
- Start the Patra Knowledge Base using Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    make up
    ```

   Once the containers are up, you can view the ingested model cards in the [Neo4j Browser](http://localhost:7474/browser/).
   - Login with the username `neo4j` and the password `PWD_HERE`.
   - Run the following query to view the model data:
     ```cypher
     MATCH (n) RETURN n
     ```

- To stop and remove all running containers, use:
    ```bash
    make down
    ```
