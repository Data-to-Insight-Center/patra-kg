  "full_description": "ResNet-152 is an 152-layer deep convolutional neural network architecture developed by Kaiming He et al. at Microsoft Research. It utilizes residual connections (skip connections) to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, enabling the effective training of deeper networks. ResNet-152 provides a strong balance between performance and computational efficiency for image classification tasks.",
